# Layoff-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset that includes details on layoffs, such as the country, industry, and company specifics. The goal is to identify trends and insights that can inform decision-making and provide a comprehensive understanding of the layoff patterns.

## Highlights

- **Dataset Cleaning**: The dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure accurate analysis. This process included removing duplicates, standardizing data, handling null values, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analysis was conducted on various data attributes including total layoffs, countries, industries, and company details.
- **Trend Analysis**: A rolling sum technique was utilized to explore monthly layoff trends.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Companies were ranked based on layoffs per year to facilitate comparative analysis.
- **Advanced Query Techniques**: Multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were used to handle complex queries efficiently and effectively.

## Key Insights

1. **Importance of Data Cleaning**: Efficient data cleaning ensures accurate analysis and insights, leading to valuable decision-making.
2. **Holistic Analysis**: Exploring total layoffs, countries, industries, and company details provides a comprehensive view of the dataset, enabling deeper insights.
3. **Trend Visualization**: Implementing rolling sum techniques helps visualize trends over time, such as monthly layoff patterns, facilitating trend identification and forecasting.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Ranking companies based on layoffs per year allows for comparative analysis to identify top performers and trends over time.
5. **Advanced Query Techniques**: The use of multiple CTEs showcases advanced query techniques to handle complex data analysis tasks efficiently and effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following fields:
- `Company`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed total layoffs.
   - Explored layoffs by country, industry, and company.
   - Utilized rolling sum for monthly layoff trends.
   - Ranked companies based on layoffs per year.

3. **Advanced Query Techniques**:
   - Implemented multiple CTEs for complex queries.

## Results

The analysis revealed several key trends and insights, such as:
- Monthly layoff patterns using rolling sum.
- Top companies with the highest layoffs per year.
- Industry and country-specific layoff trends.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the importance of data cleaning and advanced query techniques in conducting meaningful exploratory data analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can inform decision-making and provide a deeper understanding of layoff patterns across various industries and countries.
